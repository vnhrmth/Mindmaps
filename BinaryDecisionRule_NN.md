# Example of a Binary Decision Rule

- A binary decision rule is a basic "yes or no" logic based on a condition.

# Rule
- `If temperature > 30°C → output = 1 (Hot)
Else → output = 0 (Not Hot)`

# Components

- **Input**: Temperature (e.g., 28°C, 35°C)
- **Condition**: Is temperature greater than 30°C?
- **Output**:  
  - `1` if condition is true (Hot)  
  - `0` if condition is false (Not Hot)

# Example Scenarios

- Input: 35°C → Output: 1 (Hot)
- Input: 25°C → Output: 0 (Not Hot)

# Why Is This Useful?

This kind of rule is used in:

- Simple control systems (e.g., turning on a fan)
- Decision-making logic
- Foundations of neural network activation functions
