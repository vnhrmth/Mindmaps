# Neural Network
## What is a Neural Network?

- A neural network is a computational model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.
- It is used in machine learning to recognize patterns, classify data, and make predictions.

## What Are the Components of a Neural Network?

  - Key components include:
    
    - Neurons (Nodes)
    - Layers
    - Weights
    - Biases
    - Activation Functions

## What is a Neuron?

- A neuron is a basic unit in a neural network that receives input, processes it, and passes output to the next layer.

## What is a Layer?

- A layer is a group of neurons. Neural networks typically have:

  - Input Layer
  - Hidden Layers
  - Output Layer

## What is an Input Layer?

- The input layer receives raw data and passes it to the next layer.

## What is a Hidden Layer?

- Hidden layers perform computations and extract features from the input data.

## What is an Output Layer?

- The output layer produces the final result, such as a classification or prediction.

## What is a Weight?

- A weight is a parameter that determines the strength of the connection between neurons.

## What is a Bias?

- A bias is an additional parameter that allows the activation function to be shifted.

## What is an Activation Function?

- An activation function determines whether a neuron should be activated or not, introducing non-linearity into the model.

#### What Are Common Activation Functions?

- Sigmoid
- ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)
- Tanh
- Softmax

## What Are the Types of Neural Networks?

  - Common types include:
    - Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)
    - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
    - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
    - Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)

## What is a Feedforward Neural Network?

- A feedforward neural network is the simplest type, where data flows in one direction from input to output.

## What is a Convolutional Neural Network?

- A CNN is designed for image processing and uses convolutional layers to detect spatial features.

## What is a Recurrent Neural Network?

- An RNN is used for sequential data like time series or text, with connections that loop back to previous steps.

## What is a Generative Adversarial Network?

- A GAN consists of two networks—a generator and a discriminator—that compete to produce realistic data.

## How Do Neural Networks Learn?

  - Neural networks learn through:
    - Forward Propagation
    - Loss Calculation
    - Backpropagation
    - Optimization

## What is Forward Propagation?

- Forward propagation is the process of passing input data through the network to generate output.

## What is Loss Calculation?

- Loss calculation measures the difference between predicted and actual output.

## What is Backpropagation?

- Backpropagation adjusts weights and biases based on the loss to improve accuracy.

## What is Optimization?

- Optimization uses algorithms like Gradient Descent to minimize the loss function.
 
## What Are Applications of Neural Networks?

  - Neural networks are used in:
    - Image and speech recognition
    - Natural language processing
    - Autonomous vehicles
    - Medical diagnosis
    - Financial forecasting
