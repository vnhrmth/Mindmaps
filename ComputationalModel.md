# Computational Model
## What is a Computational Model?

- A computational model is a mathematical and algorithmic representation of a real-world system or process.
- Designed to simulate, analyze, or predict its behavior using computers.

## What Are the Components of a Computational Model?

- Key components include:

  - Variables
  - Parameters
  - Equations or Rules
  - Algorithms
  - Initial Conditions

## What is a Variable?

- A variable represents a quantity that can change during the simulation or computation.

## What is a Parameter?

- A parameter is a fixed value that defines the behavior or characteristics of the model.

## What Are Equations or Rules?

- Equations or rules define how variables interact and evolve over time.

## What is an Algorithm?

- An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure used to solve problems or simulate the model.

## What Are Initial Conditions?

- Initial conditions specify the starting values of variables before the model begins running.

## What Are the Types of Computational Models?

- Common types include:
  - Mathematical Models
  - Simulation Models
  - Machine Learning Models
  - Agent-Based Models

## What is a Mathematical Model?

- A mathematical model uses mathematical equations to represent relationships between variables.


## What is a Simulation Model?

- A simulation model mimics the behavior of a system over time, often using random sampling or iterative processes.

## What is a Machine Learning Model?

- A machine learning model learns patterns from data and makes predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

## What is an Agent-Based Model?

- An agent-based model simulates interactions of autonomous agents to assess their effects on the system as a whole.

## What Are the Applications of Computational Models?

- Computational models are used in:
  - Scientific research
  - Engineering design
