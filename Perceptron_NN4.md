# Simplest Neural Network
## What is the Simplest Neural Network?

- The simplest neural network is a **single-layer perceptron**
- Consists of one input layer and one output neuron.
- It is capable of solving basic linear classification problems.

## What is a Perceptron?

- A perceptron is the most basic type of artificial neuron that takes multiple inputs,
- applies weights
- sums them
-  passes the result through an activation function to produce an output.

## What Are the Components of a Perceptron?

- Inputs
- Weights
- Bias
- Summation Function
- Activation Function

## What is an Input?

- An input is a numerical value representing a feature of the data.

## What is a Weight?

- A weight determines the importance of each input in the decision-making process.

## What is a Bias?

- A bias is a constant added to the weighted sum to shift the activation function.

## What is a Summation Function?

- The summation function calculates the weighted sum of inputs plus bias.

## What is an Activation Function?

- An activation function decides whether the neuron should "fire" or not.

## What Are Common Activation Functions in a Perceptron?

- Step Function (used in classic perceptrons)
- Sigmoid
- ReLU

## What Is the Purpose of a Single-Layer Perceptron?

- It is used for:
  - Binary classification
  - Linearly separable problems

## How Does a Perceptron Learn?

- Learning involves:

  - Initializing weights and bias
  - Calculating output
  - Comparing output with expected result
  - Updating weights using a learning rule

## What Is the Learning Rule?

- The most common rule is the **Perceptron Learning Algorithm**,
- Adjusts weights based on the error between predicted and actual output.

## What Are the Limitations of a Single-Layer Perceptron?

- Can only solve linearly separable problems
- Cannot model complex patterns or non-linear relationships

## What Is an Example of a Problem It Can Solve?

- Logical AND and OR functions

## What Is an Example of a Problem It Cannot Solve?

- XOR function (requires a multi-layer network)
